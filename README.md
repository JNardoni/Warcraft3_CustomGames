# Warcraft

Contains Warcraft 3 custom games, all open and unlocked. Each game has a stable and test map. Each also includes an Excel About page with design decesions and parts
to implement. There are 2 games currently.

1. Phantom Mode 

      This is based on the game Phantom Mode from Starcraft 2. In the game there are 3 roles: Slayers, Paladins, and Phantoms. It is a game of deception where Slayers and Paladins work together to find and destroy the Phantoms, while the Phantoms will try to destory all other players. All roles are hidden from other players, though Phantoms will be revealed to eachother after a set amount of time. 

2. Tug of War

      The game is composed of a series of rounds, where each round players will battle 1v1 in a hero line war. Units alive at the end of each round will cause the enemy team to lose points. When a player loses all points they are eliminated											
											
                      
The games are largely in and out of development, and more of an outlet for creativity than anything meant to be released.
